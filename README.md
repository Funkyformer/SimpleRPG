# SimpleRPG
Created by Austin Goodloe

SimpleRPG is a very basic proof of concept for a standard JRPG, featuring grid-based player movement and collision checking, random encounters, and turn-based combat.

Created utilizing [Godot](https://godotengine.org/)

The biggest hurdle here was very much getting started. This was my first time using Godot, and on top of being a game engine I'm unfamiliar with, it also has its own scripting language that I had to learn (though the custom Godot language is relatively simple). The Godot page does have a relatively complete tutorial for learning about how things like nodes work, and how to actually write in the godot script.

To run SimpleRPG, you should only need to download the .exe and .pck files in the main directory, outside of the folder. Make sure those two files stay in the same folder and just run the .exe.
