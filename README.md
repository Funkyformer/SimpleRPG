# SimpleRPG
Created by Austin Goodloe

SimpleRPG is a very basic proof of concept for a standard JRPG, featuring grid-based player movement and collision checking, random encounters, and turn-based combat.

Created utilizing [Godot](https://godotengine.org/)

The biggest hurdle here was very much getting started. This was my first time using Godot, and on top of being a game engine I'm unfamiliar with, it also has its own scripting language that I had to learn (though the custom Godot language is relatively simple). The Godot page does have a relatively complete tutorial for learning about how things like nodes work, and how to actually write in the godot script.
